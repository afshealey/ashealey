### Predicting Flight Delays Departing from NYC Airports
This project was completed in R as a final assignment in the Statistical Learning class I took. I worked independently to build advanced regression models (KNN, ElasticNet, Regression Forest) using data collected by the United States DOT Bureau of Transportation Statistics on over 300,000 flights. Optimal model was able to predict departure time within, on average, about 6 minutes.
